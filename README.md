## Overview
Volunteer Connect is a React-based application designed to streamline the process of volunteering. Whether you're an individual looking to contribute your time or an organization seeking assistance, Volunteer Connect has you covered. With its intuitive interface and robust features, managing and participating in volunteering activities has never been easier.
This was a 3 week long project built at the end of EDIT Junior React JS. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  
At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, D3, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app`

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An inviting homepage introduces users to the platform and its creator.
- **Dynamic Activity Management:** Administrators can effortlessly add and manage volunteering activities, while users can explore and apply for available opportunities.
- **Dual Modes:** Seamlessly switch between user and admin modes, each tailored to specific roles and responsibilities.
- **Efficient Volunteer Management:** Administrators can oversee volunteers, adding new entries and updating existing profiles as needed.
- **Organization Approval Workflow:** Users can propose new organizations for inclusion, subject to approval by administrators before being visible to others.
- **Notification Center:** Stay informed with important updates and announcements, managed and moderated by administrators.
